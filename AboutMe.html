      <p class="w3-opacity w3-center"><i>Teyah</i></p><br />
      <p class="w3-white w3-text-black w3-center">
    Hello, my name is Teyah, and I started this business because of my deep love for cats. I offer reliable, in-home care for your beloved moggies‚Äîfeeding them, giving them plenty of cuddles, and even helping with small household tasks like watering your plants.
    I‚Äôve recently completed A-Levels in Maths, Computing, Further Maths, and Physics, and I‚Äôm currently working towards becoming a Software Engineer. I‚Äôm also able to drive, which makes it easy for me to reach clients across the area.
    At home, I have four wonderful cats of my own: Basil, who is 11, and three one-year-old Maine Coons‚ÄîTonka, Ghost, and Sage. The younger three have very specific feeding needs, so I understand how important tailored care is. I‚Äôve been running this business for over two years now, and I genuinely couldn‚Äôt love it more.
    Now that you know a little about me, let me introduce you to my cats‚Ä¶ üêæ

    <div class="w3-half">
      <h3>Mitch & Daisy</h3>
      <p>Mitch and Daisy were the very first cats I ever had. I was very young when Daisy sadly passed away, so my memories of her are limited, but I‚Äôll always remember her sweet nature. Mitch, on the other hand, lived until he was 9 and left me with so many memories of how affectionate and cuddly he was. He had a huge personality and an even bigger heart.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="w3-half">
      <h3>Chilli</h3>
      <p>Chilli was a loving and very talkative kitty who brought us joy for an incredible 15 years. She was affectionate, vocal, and had a strong presence in the home. A bit shy at first, but once she trusted you, you couldn‚Äôt help but adore her. Her gentle soul made her unforgettable.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="w3-half">
      <h3>Pepper</h3>
      <p>Pepper was our first fluffy bundle of joy. Completely adorable and totally in love with her favourite cushion, she charmed everyone. She also lived a full and happy 15 years, passing away just 6 months before her sister Chilli.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="w3-half">
      <h3>Saffron</h3>
      <p>Saffron was only with us for a year and a half, but she left a lasting impression. She loved cuddles and had a hilarious habit of rolling down the stairs when stroked‚Äîwe nicknamed her "the slinky". She was a joy, even in the short time we had with her.</p>

  <!-- Basil -->

    </div>
    <div class="w3-half">
      <h3>Basil</h3>
      <p>At 11 years old, Basil is our only moggie and he‚Äôs full of character. He can be a bit feisty at times, but when he curls up on your lap, there‚Äôs nothing sweeter. His love of laps and his big personality make him one of a kind.</p>

  <!-- Tonka -->

    <div class="w3-half">
      <h3>Tonka</h3>
      <p>Tonka is a silver tabby Maine Coon and the first of our fluffy trio. At 16 months old and weighing 7kg, he‚Äôs my not-so-little boy. He‚Äôs incredibly affectionate, loves being cuddled by us, but also has a mischievous side that keeps us on our toes!</p>

  <!-- Ghost -->

    <div class="w3-half">
      <img src="images/Ghost.jpg" alt="Ghost" class="w3-image" />
    </div>
    <div class="w3-half">
      <h3>Ghost</h3>
      <p>Ghost is our 13-month-old black smoke Maine Coon. He‚Äôs got a cheeky streak, can be a little clumsy, and sometimes struggles with jumping‚Äîbut that only makes him more lovable. He has a special bond with my dad and is happiest when cuddled up with him.</p>
    </div>

  <!-- Sage -->
  <div class="w3-row-padding w3-margin-top">

    </div>
    <div class="w3-half">
      <h3>Sage</h3>
      <p>Sage is our only girl Maine Coon and the sweetest little cherub. Just two weeks younger than Ghost, she‚Äôs full of love and affection. She adores rubbing her face against yours, giving gentle licks and playful nibbles. Everything in the house, in her eyes, belongs to her‚Äîand she carries that confidence with cuteness!</p>
