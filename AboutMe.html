        <p class="about-text">
          Hello, my name is Teyah, and I started this business because of my
          deep love for cats. I offer reliable, in-home care for your beloved
          moggies‚Äîfeeding them, giving them plenty of cuddles, and even helping
          with small household tasks like watering your plants. I‚Äôve recently
          completed A-Levels in Maths, Computing, Further Maths, and Physics,
          and I‚Äôm currently working towards becoming a Software Engineer. I‚Äôm
          also able to drive, which makes it easy for me to reach clients across
          the area. At home, I have four wonderful cats of my own: Basil, who is
          11, and three one-year-old Maine Coons‚ÄîTonka, Ghost, and Sage. The
          younger three have very specific feeding needs, so I understand how
          important tailored care is. I‚Äôve been running this business for over
          two years now, and I genuinely couldn‚Äôt love it more. Now that you
          know a little about me, let me introduce you to my cats‚Ä¶ üêæ

          <h3>Mitch & Daisy</h3>
          <p>
            Mitch and Daisy were the very first cats I ever had. I was very
            young when Daisy sadly passed away, so my memories of her are
            limited, but I‚Äôll always remember her sweet nature. Mitch, on the
            other hand, lived until he was 9 and left me with so many memories
            of how affectionate and cuddly he was. He had a huge personality and
            an even bigger heart.

          <h3>Chilli</h3>
          <p>
            Chilli was a loving and very talkative kitty who brought us joy for
            an incredible 15 years. She was affectionate, vocal, and had a
            strong presence in the home. A bit shy at first, but once she
            trusted you, you couldn‚Äôt help but adore her. Her gentle soul made
            her unforgettable.

          <h3>Pepper</h3>
          <p>
            Pepper was our first fluffy bundle of joy. Completely adorable and
            totally in love with her favourite cushion, she charmed everyone.
            She also lived a full and happy 15 years, passing away just 6 months
            before her sister Chilli.

          <h3>Saffron</h3>
          <p>
            Saffron was only with us for a year and a half, but she left a
            lasting impression. She loved cuddles and had a hilarious habit of
            rolling down the stairs when stroked‚Äîwe nicknamed her "the slinky".
            She was a joy, even in the short time we had with her.

          <h3>Basil</h3>
          <p>
            At 11 years old, Basil is our only moggie and he‚Äôs full of
            character. He can be a bit feisty at times, but when he curls up on
            your lap, there‚Äôs nothing sweeter. His love of laps and his big
            personality make him one of a kind.vvvv

          <h3>Tonka</h3>
          <p>
            Tonka is a silver tabby Maine Coon and the first of our fluffy trio.
            At 16 months old and weighing 7kg, he‚Äôs my not-so-little boy. He‚Äôs
            incredibly affectionate, loves being cuddled by us, but also has a
            mischievous side that keeps us on our toes!

          <h3>Ghost</h3>
          <p>
            Ghost is our 13-month-old black smoke Maine Coon. He‚Äôs got a cheeky
            streak, can be a little clumsy, and sometimes struggles with
            jumping‚Äîbut that only makes him more lovable. He has a special bond
            with my dad and is happiest when cuddled up with him.

          <p>
            Sage is our only girl Maine Coon and the sweetest little cherub.
            Just two weeks younger than Ghost, she‚Äôs full of love and affection.
            She adores rubbing her face against yours, giving gentle licks and
            playful nibbles. Everything in the house, in her eyes, belongs to
            her‚Äîand she carries that confidence with cuteness!
