      <!-- Regulars Section -->
      <section>
        <h3>Regulars</h3>

        <h4>Roger & Raymond</h4>
        <p>Roger and Raymond are two incredibly sweet and affectionate boys I’ve been looking after since April 2024. They’re very regular customers now, and it’s always a joy to see them!</p>
        <img src="images/Roger and Raymond.jpg" alt="Roger and Raymond cats" class="w3-image w3-margin-bottom" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;" />

        
        <h4>Twiggy & Indie</h4>
        <p>I’ve had the pleasure of caring for Twiggy and Indie quite a few times now. Indie absolutely loves affection, while Twiggy is a little on the shy side—but still enjoys a good cuddle when she warms up to you.</p>
        <div class="w3-row-padding w3-margin-bottom">
          <div class="w3-half">
            <img src="images/Twiggy.jpg" alt="Twiggy the cat" class="w3-image" />
          </div>
          <div class="w3-half">
            <img src="images/Indie.jpg" alt="Indie the cat" class="w3-image" />
          </div>
        </div>

        <h4>Turbo</h4>
        <img src="images/Turbo.jpg" alt="Turbo the Maine Coon cat" class="w3-image w3-margin-bottom" />
        <p>Turbo is a Maine Coon just like my own cat, so we bonded instantly. He’s full of cuddles and affection—an absolutely adorable boy.</p>

        <h4>Keira</h4>
        <img src="images/Keira.jpg" alt="Keira the cat" class="w3-image w3-margin-bottom" />
        <p>Keira always makes me smile. Every time I walk in, she greets me right away—it’s the cutest thing! I’ve looked after her a few times now and she’s definitely one of my favourites.</p>

        <h4>Mali & Lola</h4>
        <img src="images/Mali.jpg" alt="Mali the cat" class="w3-image w3-margin-bottom" />
        <p>Mali and Lola are a little different—they're part of my weekly routine! I visit them on the same days every week. You’ll only spot Mali here, as Lola (a dog) isn’t too keen on me, but Mali more than makes up for it with his endless cuddles.</p>

      <!-- Kittens Section -->
      <section>
        <h3>The Kittens</h3>
        <p>Over the years, I’ve had the special opportunity to care for some very young kittens. These experiences were truly heartwarming and unforgettable.</p>

        <h4>Cookie</h4>
        <img src="images/Cookie.jpg" alt="Cookie the kitten" class="w3-image w3-margin-bottom" />
        <p>Cookie was a tiny 10-week-old kitten who stayed in my home for a week while her owners were away. Because of her age, I offered a more hands-on service at the time. While it’s not something I accommodate now, it worked perfectly back then.</p>

        <h4>Merlin</h4>
        <img src="images/Merlin.jpg" alt="Merlin the kitten" class="w3-image w3-margin-bottom" />
        <p>At just 5 months old, Merlin was the perfect mix of playful and cuddly. I visited him three times a day, and he brought so much joy each time.</p>

        <h4>Rothko</h4>
        <img src="images/Rothko.jpg" alt="Rothko the kitten" class="w3-image w3-margin-bottom" />
        <p>Rothko was only 6 months old when I looked after him. He followed me everywhere while I sorted his food and litter—it was honestly the cutest thing.</p>

        <h4>Stormi & Her Kittens</h4>
        <img src="images/Stormi&Kittens.jpg" alt="Stormi and her kittens" class="w3-image w3-margin-bottom" />
        <p>Stormi, an 18-month-old cat, had a surprise litter of 4-week-old kittens right before her owners had to attend a wedding. I stayed overnight for two days to help out. It was a big responsibility—I weighed the kittens regularly to ensure they were growing well and updated their owners with everything.</p>

      <!-- Other Cats Section -->
      <section>
        <h3>Other Cats</h3>

        <h4>Tilly & Tabby</h4>
        <div class="w3-row-padding w3-margin-bottom">
          <div class="w3-half">
            <img src="images/Tilly.jpg" alt="Tilly the cat" class="w3-image" />
          </div>
          <div class="w3-half">
            <img src="images/Tabby.jpg" alt="Tabby the cat" class="w3-image" />
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Tilly and Tabby are two cats I’ve looked after a couple of times. Tilly was very shy and preferred to stay hidden, while Tabby enjoyed a bit of affection before dinner.</p>

        <h4>Toby</h4>
        <img src="images/Toby.jpg" alt="Toby the cat" class="w3-image w3-margin-bottom" />
        <p>Toby is a very vocal cat. Whenever I came by, he was quick to make his presence known—and his owners really appreciated that I gave him lots of attention.</p>

      <h4>Lilo & Stitch</h4>
      <div class="photo-pair">
        <img src="images/Lilo.jpg" alt="Lilo the cat" />
        <img src="images/Stitch.jpg" alt="Stitch the cat" />
      </div>
      <p>Lilo and Stitch were some of my very first customers. They were both young, playful, and full of character—I absolutely loved looking after them.</p>

      <h4>Coco, Max & Puss Puss</h4>
      <p>This lovely trio live together in the same home. Puss Puss preferred to keep her distance, Max was glued to me and constantly wanted strokes, and Coco was somewhere in between—not fussed either way!
      <div class="photo-trio">
        <img src="images/Coco.jpg" alt="Coco the cat" />
        <img src="images/Max.jpg" alt="Max the cat" />
        <img src="images/Puss Puss.jpg" alt="Puss Puss the cat" />
      </div>

      <p class="w3-small w3-center w3-margin-top">And many more happy cats I’ve loved caring for over the years!</p>
