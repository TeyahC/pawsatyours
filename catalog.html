                I’ve had the pleasure of caring for Twiggy and Indie quite a few

                little on the shy side—but still enjoys a good cuddle when she
                warms up to you.

                spot Mali here, as Lola (a dog) isn’t too keen on me, but Mali
                more than makes up for it with his endless cuddles.

            Over the years, I’ve had the special opportunity to care for some

              <p class="customer-description">
                Cookie was a tiny 10-week-old kitten who stayed in my home for a
                week while her owners were away. Because of her age, I offered a
                more hands-on service at the time. While it’s not something I
                accommodate now, it worked perfectly back then.

                At just 5 months old, Merlin was the perfect mix of playful and
                cuddly. I visited him three times a day, and he brought so much
                joy each time.

                Rothko was only 6 months old when I looked after him. He

                honestly the cutest thing.

                Stormi, an 18-month-old cat, had a surprise litter of 4-week-old
                kittens right before her owners had to attend a wedding. I
                stayed overnight for two days to help out. I weighed the kittens
                regularly and updated their owners with everything.

                Tilly and Tabby are two cats I’ve looked after a couple of
