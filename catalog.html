    <h2>Our Lovely Customers</h2>
    <p>Meet some of the wonderful cats I’ve had the pleasure of caring for through Paws at Yours.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Regulars</h3>

      <h4>Roger & Raymond</h4>
      <img src="images/roger-raymond.jpg" alt="Roger and Raymond cats" class="single-photo" />
      <p>Roger and Raymond are two incredibly sweet and affectionate boys I’ve been looking after since April 2024. They’re very regular customers now, and it’s always a joy to see them!</p>

      <h4>Twiggy & Indie</h4>
      <p>I’ve had the pleasure of caring for Twiggy and Indie quite a few times now. Indie absolutely loves affection, while Twiggy is a little on the shy side—but still enjoys a good cuddle when she warms up to you.</p>

        <img src="images/indie.jpg" alt="Indie the cat" />
      </div>

      <h4>Turbo</h4>
      <img src="images/turbo.jpg" alt="Turbo the Maine Coon cat" class="single-photo" />
      <p>Turbo is a Maine Coon just like my own cat, so we bonded instantly. He’s full of cuddles and affection—an absolutely adorable boy.</p>

      <h4>Keira</h4>
      <img src="images/keira.jpg" alt="Keira the cat" class="single-photo" />
      <p>Keira always makes me smile. Every time I walk in, she greets me right away—it’s the cutest thing! I’ve looked after her a few times now and she’s definitely one of my favourites.</p>

      <h4>Mali & Lola</h4>
      <img src="images/mali.jpg" alt="Mali the dog" class="single-photo" />
      <p>Mali and Lola are a little different—they're part of my weekly routine! I visit them on the same days every week. You’ll only spot Mali here, as Lola (a dog) isn’t too keen on me, but Mali more than makes up for it with her endless cuddles.</p>

      <h3>The Kittens</h3>
      <p>Over the years, I’ve had the special opportunity to care for some very young kittens. These experiences were truly heartwarming and unforgettable.</p>

      <h4>Cookie</h4>
      <img src="images/cookie.jpg" alt="Cookie the kitten" class="single-photo" />
      <p>Cookie was a tiny 10-week-old kitten who stayed in my home for a week while her owners were away. Because of her age, I offered a more hands-on service at the time. While it’s not something I accommodate now, it worked perfectly back then.</p>

      <h4>Merlin</h4>
      <img src="images/merlin.jpg" alt="Merlin the kitten" class="single-photo" />
      <p>At just 5 months old, Merlin was the perfect mix of playful and cuddly. I visited him three times a day, and he brought so much joy each time.</p>

      <h4>Rothko</h4>
      <img src="images/rothko.jpg" alt="Rothko the kitten" class="single-photo" />
      <p>Rothko was only 6 months old when I looked after him. He followed me everywhere while I sorted his food and litter—it was honestly the cutest thing.</p>

      <h4>Stormi & Her Kittens</h4>
      <img src="images/stormi-and-kittens.jpg" alt="Stormi and her kittens" class="single-photo" />
      <p>Stormi, an 18-month-old cat, had a surprise litter of 4-week-old kittens right before her owners had to attend a wedding. I stayed overnight for two days to help out. It was a big responsibility—I weighed the kittens regularly to ensure they were growing well and updated their owners with everything.</p>

      <h3>Other Cats</h3>

      <h4>Tilly & Tabby</h4>
      <div class="photo-pair">
        <img src="images/tilly.jpg" alt="Tilly the cat" />
        <img src="images/tabby.jpg" alt="Tabby the cat" />
      </div>
      <p>Tilly and Tabby are two cats I’ve looked after a couple of times. Tilly was very shy and preferred to stay hidden, while Tabby enjoyed a bit of affection before dinner.</p>

      <h4>Toby</h4>
      <img src="images/toby.jpg" alt="Toby the cat" class="single-photo" />
      <p>Toby was a one-day visit while his owners were away for the weekend. I stayed for an hour to keep him company and top up his food. He spent the entire time curled up on my lap—it was the sweetest thing!</p>

      <h4>Lilo & Stitch</h4>
      <div class="photo-pair">
        <img src="https://ibb.co/Kpr5XSqv" alt="Lilo the cat" />
        <img src="images/stitch.jpg" alt="Stitch the cat" />
      </div>
      <p>Lilo and Stitch were some of my very first customers. They were both young, playful, and full of character—I absolutely loved looking after them.</p>

      <h4>Coco, Max & Puss Puss</h4>
      <p>This lovely trio live together in the same home. Puss Puss preferred to keep her distance, Max was glued to me and constantly wanted strokes, and Coco was
