            “I was really worried about leaving my cat alone for the first time,
            but Teyah made me feel completely at ease. Despite her young age,
            she’s very knowledgeable about cats and clearly has solid
            experience. She’s not a full-time pet sitter, which I think makes a
            big difference as she genuinely cares about each pet she looks
            after, rather than just treating it as a job.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Teyah is flexible, responsible, and always goes the extra mile. If
            anything unexpected happens, she handles it calmly and keeps you
            informed. She’s polite, down-to-earth, and has such a calm energy
            that pets really respond to.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “At one point, I even thought my cat liked her more than me 😄. I’m
            really grateful for her help and hope she continues pet sitting so I
            can continue using her services again! 🤣”

      “Teyah did an amazing job looking after my three cats over
      Christmas. One of my boys needs daily medication, and she let me
      know every morning that he had taken it, while also updating me on
      how everyone was doing. She sent photos every day too! I would
      definitely recommend her.”
